        <h1> Reasons why you need a website for your business.</h1>
        <h2>1. A website makes you look professional</h2>
        <span style="color: aqua;"> 84% of today’s consumers think a website makes your business more credible than
            companies who only have social
            media
            profiles.</span> Your website is also the perfect place to show off any professional certifications or
        awards your business has.
        <br>
        Beyond that, having your own website lets you create a branded email address (e.g. dianna@yoursite.com) which
            adds a level of professionalism to all of your correspondence, especially if you’ve used a personal email
            address to conduct business up until now. In addition, some email marketing tools no longer allow users to
            send emails from personal addresses. This means that if you want to take advantage of the power of email
            marketing, you’ll need a business email account.<br><br> 
             <h2> 2. Your website can attract new customers through Google</h2>
                You may be happy with the current size of your business, but every company experiences customer
                turnover. To encourage continued success, you need to attract new customers, and one of the best ways to
                do it is by making yourself more visible on Google.
                Social media networks are indexed on Google, and social media posts can be found with the search engine,
                but a website gives you access to many more tools and strategies for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
                And SEO is the key to making
                your business appear on the front page of Google. The phrase “search engine optimization” might be
                intimidating, but in practice, it’s fairly simple. You enter words and phrases related to your business
                into a keyword research tool, figure
                out which ones are getting the most traffic on Google, then build your content around those phrases. As
                a rule, each piece of content should be focused on a different keyword, so that as your list of content
                grows, your site is able to
                rank for more keywords. There are some excellent SEO plugins for WordPress that make it easy to do this,
                no previous training required.<br><br> 

                <h2> 3. You can clearly showcase your products and services</h2>
                You can show potential customers what they’ll get when they work with you by displaying high-quality
                photography on your website. Take a look at how the UK restaurant Blackhouse has accomplished this on
                their website:<br> The Blockhouse
                business needs a website to show pictures of its food You can also use your website design, along with
                the featured images, to give people a sense of what it feels like to enter your physical location. This
                works particularly well if your
                brand is closely tied to the “feel” of your location, like the Canadian restaurant Stormcrow Manor.<br>
                The Stormcrown Manner need a website to give a feel for its decor Another thing you can do is publish
                important information about your
                products and services on your website to make sure you’re attracting the right customers. For example,
                if you run a restaurant, you might want to mark any items on your menu that are gluten-free so people
                with Celiac or other conditions
                that make gluten dangerous know they can eat in your establishment. <br><br>

                <h2> 4. You can display your best reviews and testimonials prominently on your website</h2>
                Displaying your best reviews and/or testimonials prominently on your website is a great way to establish
                social proof. This might come in the form of personal customer testimonials, like this review on the
                website of the non-profit organization STEAMLabs:<br> Testimonials at the Steamlabs website If your
                business has appeared in articles from newspapers or popular local blogs, you can also feature those, as
                Stormcrow Manor has done below:<br> Storm Crow manner publication list Publishing your
                best reviews on your website also serves the secondary purpose of creating a permanent archive. This
                means that even if third-party review sites close at some point in the future, you’ll still have access
                to your best reviews.
                <br><br> 

                <h2>5. A website can encourage customers to contact you</h2>
                A website is a great place to make your contact information easily available to potential customers. You
                can even publish your contact information in a header or footer so it appears on every single page.
                Snakes and Lattes, a small chain of board game
                cafes, has placed phone numbers for all four of their locations in their website footer: Snakes and
                Lattes displaying its various locations Modern website builders (more on those in a bit) also make it
                easy to create a contact form, which
                can protect your business email from spam.<br><br> 

                <h2>6. You can integrate your website with Google Maps so people can find you more easily</h2>
                A website lets you embed maps directly into your content. Some businesses, like STEAMLabs, have a map
                embedded directly onto their home page: Steamlabs embeds a Google Maps map An embedded map makes it easy
                for people who don’t spend a lot of time in
                your area to find your business. This is particularly great if you host events, as they might attract
                people who wouldn’t otherwise spend time in the neighborhood your business is in.<br><br> 

                <h2> 7. Your website establishes your place in your industry</h2>
                As of 2021, 71% of small businesses have websites and 81% of customers research things online before
                they buy them. In other words, if your competitors are online and you’re not, those competitors get the
                first interactions with customers. Creating a
                website gives you a space to share what your business is about, establish your role in the industry, and
                connect with the customers who need you.<br><br> 

                <h2> 8. A website ensures your success over the long term</h2>
                As of January 2021, almost 4.66 billion people (59.5% of the global population) used the Internet. In
                many countries, that number is much higher. In the US, for example, over 90% of people are online.
                Without a website, your business is invisible to these
                people. As we progress further into the digital era, your business will become invisible to everyone
                unless you invest in a website. So to stay competitive in this increasingly digital world, your business
                needs to get online.<br>
                <br> So, do I need a website for my business? The final verdict Hopefully, by now you’ve realized that
                the question isn’t “do I need a website for my business”, but “can I afford to not have a website in the
                digital era”. And the answer,
                if you want to continue thriving in the long term, is no. More and more, even staying afloat without a
                business website is impossible. Your customers are online, your competitors are online, and if you’re
                not there to intervene, your competitors
                and your customers will connect, leaving you in the lurch.
